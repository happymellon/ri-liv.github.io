Talking about life, liberty, and the pursuit of... what?

# Editing the site:
If you want to edit something, please carefully comment and document what you change. Thoroughly test it before you commiit. 

Ideally, you can just give me stuff you want to change and I'll write it :). 

# Uploading a new post
If you want to make a new post: 
You can copy the file called 'post_template.html'. 
Scroll down until you see "< div class="post_content">" and start writing there!
After that, please send me a message just being like "hey I wrote a new post on [some date]", and I'll update everything else on the website!

Alternatively, you can just send me whatever you want to post and I'll do it all for you!

https://stackedit.io/app# should be a good site to use... probably :'). 

# Why are we doing this super inconvenient thing?
Because I don't feel like trying to install/use random stuff and I want to make it all from scratch (rather than having something generate it for me) (aka I am too lazy to do something that will lead to greater efficiency overall)!

# If I'm a random person and I want to contribute, what do I do?
If you're willing to dedicate some time every week, send us an email and we'll consider letting you join our team!
Otherwise, if you only want to write a few posts occasionally, we welcome all guests posts!
